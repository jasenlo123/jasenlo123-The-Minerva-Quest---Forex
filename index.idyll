***tldr: Foreign exchange (Forex) rate volatility affects all non-American students at Minerva. The Quest uses historical Forex data to investigate which students have been affected by changing Forex rates. Long-term Forex rate changes could have benefited some whose currencies have appreciated against the USD, but majority of currencies have depreciated against the USD. Particularly, students from countries such as Argentina, Uruguay, Pakistan, and Brazil, have seen their tuition fees skyrocket because of dramatic currency devaluation against the USD.***
[hr /]

According to data provided by Teri Cannon, Minervaâ€™s Chief Student Affairs and Operations Officer, and compiled by Emma Stiefel, Minerva Quest Editor-in-Chief, 77 nationalities and 66 currencies are represented in the Minerva students body. **That's a lot of different currencies.** 

Minerva students pay tuition in United States Dollars (USD), but the actual value of tuition changes every second because of changes in foreign exchange rates (forex). Depending on how much people want a particular currency, the value of that currency relative to all other currencies changes accordingly.

A Quest report on the state of financial aid at Minerva details how forex has negatively affected students' ability to pay for Minerva tuition fees in two ways:

* **Long-term currency devaluation** - A currency that continuously weakens against the USD effectively raises tuition costs for students who purchase USD from their home currency to pay tuition fees. This type of devaluation hits students whose families have saved their home currency to pay Minerva tuition particularly hard as the value of their savings depreciates proportional to the weakening of their currency. 

* **Short-term currency fluctuations** - Financial aid packages are released in March, whereas term bill payments are due in July and November for the fall and spring semesters respectively. If a currency's value changes in the months between these dates and if a student pays for the term bill in that currency, their expected family contribution changes proportionally with the change in their currency's value.

Members of the Minerva community have likely heard of anecdots of students struggling with tuition fees because of changing forex rates. This Quest report investigates how forex affects different students quantitatively having gathered the forex data for the 65 currencies used in countries where at least one Minerva student identifies as their country of origin (except Zimbabwe & Venezuela, hyper-inflated data).

**Which students pay more and pay less because of their currencies-of-origin? And by roughly how much or little?**

Giovanna Chaves (M'20), told the Quest that because of currency devaluation in Brazil, her home country, her first-year term bill from 2016 would cost almost twice as many Brazilian reals if she had to pay it in 2020. Many students would be financially ruined if their school fees rose so dramatically, but this is the reality for those from countries that use currencies that have consistently weakened against the USD.

The Quest used historical forex rates to determine how much a student has had to pay for Minerva tuition, housing, and student services costs if they paid entirely using their respective currencies-of-origin. **Data normalised to be in terms of 2017 USD through end-of-year currency conversion and inflation adjustment.** Note that the above data are only approximations because of inflation adjustment and how end-of-year forex rates were used for currency conversion even though tuition is usually due in the June/July (Fall) and November/December (Spring). 
**It is likely that some figures are underestimated given how wages in some places do not match the rate of inflation.** Complete methodological notes are available here.

The estimated data supports Chaves' claim that her tuition cost almost doubled between 2017 and 2020, from yearly tuition of $24,450 to a frightening $36,891 (2017 USD).

  Sidenote: flat-ish trend of the USD in this chart means that tuition + housing + student services fees have stayed relatively constant in real terms (between $24,500 - $25,000) -  costs are only rising at a rate that matches inflation.

[section className:"article-body"]
The incredible cost increase for students using consistently weakening currencies is troubling, especially for those whose families do not have savings in USD or depend on their income in their home currencies to afford the student's expected family contribution. A hypothetical student paying for the Fall20 and Spring21 semesters at the end of the 2020 calendar year entirely in Argentine peso, Turkish lira or the Brazillian real would have paid upwards of $33,000, while a student paying in USD would have only paid approximately $24,500. 

Fortunately, students who are most severely affected by long-term currency devaluation likely receive financial aid in scholarships and work-study wages, which are paid in USD. Many of these students and their families might have had the foresight to purchase USD long before their currencies' depreciation. However, even if the student paid a substantial portion of their Minerva costs in USD, the remaining amount would still be prohibitively expensive in their currencies-of-origin. 

An additional implication is that if students from countries with weak currencies have taken on student debt, they are more or less obliged to find employment in the United States or another country with a strong currency. It will be much harder to service loans if their wages from a job at home are paid to them in such a weak currency than to service loans using earnings in USD. It is impossible to predict the emergence of and impacts of political and economic events on forex rates, but would a student from Argentina have second thoughts about attending Minerva if they knew their education would cost approximately $130,000 (2017 USD) in Argentine pesos and a commitment to working in the United States to pay off student debt?

How did the Quest convert to 2017 USD for a specific semester term bill and currency? An example with the Brazillian Real and 2020 Fall Semester:

* $12975 (2020 USD) â†’ 2020 USD/BRL Forex Conversion â†’ 
* R$XXXXX (2020 BRL) â†’ 2020 BRL to BRL 2017 Inflation Conversion â†’
* R$XXXXX (2017 BRL) â†’  2017 BRL/USD Forex Conversion â†’
* $20918 (2017 USD) - How much the 2020 Fall term bill costs to a student paying with Brazillian Real in terms of 2017 USD.

The operation above was carried out for every currency that are used in countries where at least one Minerva student identifies as their country of origin, as the table below shows the term bill amount in 2017 USD for these currencies:
